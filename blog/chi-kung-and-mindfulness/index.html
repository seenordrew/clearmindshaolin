		<p>Some years ago, a friend that doesn’t practice chi kung asked me if practicing chi kung could raise your IQ.  I gave her a somewhat brief answer explaining that I didn’t think practicing chi kung would alter the level of intelligence a person is born with, but it would certainly allow a person to make better use of the IQ they have.  A longer explanation is as follows.</p>

		<p>I believe that the main reason chi kung can improve a person’s thinking and allow them to make better use of their natural intelligence is because practicing chi kung increases their mental clarity.  Mental clarity is a topic we discuss a lot in Shaolin Wahnam and is a benefit many practitioners reportedly enjoy.  In my experience, I can say that practicing chi kung indeed has improved my mental clarity.  For someone who has never practiced Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung or has not experienced mental clarity, they might be wondering what mental clarity is.</p>


		<p>To be concise, mental clarity is when the mind is quiet and peaceful, free of unwanted thoughts.  This does not mean a person has become incapable of thinking; it means thoughts arise only when they want them or need them.  A person with mental clarity can find solutions to problems very easily, can quickly make choices that seem difficult to others, can react to unexpected circumstances without hesitation, can learn with ease and can carry out their work or play without getting distracted by something irrelevant.  This might sound abnormal these days, as many people generally feel overwhelmed by their own thinking.</p>

		<p>I shall paraphrase an example of mental clarity I have heard Sifu Wong give on various occasions:</p>

		<p class="blog-quote">“Let’s say you are in a gymnasium with three other people, and you want to find which one of those three people is wearing a watch.  It will be very easy to find that person.  But now let’s say you are in the same gymnasium with 200 people, only one of them is wearing a watch and you want to find them.  Now it will be quite difficult.  In the same way, when you have mental clarity you can easily find the solution you want or pinpoint the thought you want to focus on.  For people with no mental clarity, it can be very difficult to find the solution or pinpoint one thought.”</p>

		<p>One of the first experiences I had of improved mental clarity was after starting chi kung as a senior in high school.  During my previous school years, whenever I had to read for homework, every now and then I would read half a page or so, but my thoughts would be elsewhere.  Once my attention came back to the page I would have no memory of what I’d just read.  This went away within a few months of practicing chi kung.  Not only was my focus better but my retention of what I’d read had gone way up, without making anymore effort than I had before. My reading ability hadn’t changed.  Practicing chi kung had flushed away a lot of mental rubbish, leaving my mind clearer and my focus better.</p>

		<p>I’ve always naturally been better at abstract, creative thinking, and I wasn’t that great in math.  What I’ve found over the years in this regard is that, while my natural math logic hasn’t changed, as my mental clarity has improved I’m better able to do the math I’m capable of.  For example, in the past I would often make small detail mistakes in a math problem.  The number of mistakes I make is now greatly reduced, despite making very little effort to improve my math skills.  My natural mathematics intelligence has not changed, but I can learn better and think more clearly, creating sort of an illusion that I’m now smarter in math.</p>

		<p>So, no, I would not say chi kung will increase a person’s IQ, but their newfound mental clarity will definitely improve their thinking.  The benefits from having increased mental clarity carry over to everything they do, whether it’s learning to draw, making an excel spreadsheet, helping someone “solve” a life “problem,” reacting to angry drivers on the highway or meditating.  Enjoying mental clarity is one of the greatest benefits you’ll receive from practicing genuine chi kung.</p>
