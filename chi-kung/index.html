    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>"Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung" is a comprehensive energy art that focuses on restoring Yin-Yang harmony in the body.  This allows practitioners to enjoy good health, vitality, longevity and spiritual cultivation in the here and now.  Benefits include: reduced stress, more mental clarity, improved overall health, a renewed zest for life and inner peace.</p>

    <p>In Chinese, Chi Kung literally means "work with energy" and is an umbrella term that refers to many different styles of energy arts. The chi kung that Sifu Wong teaches is termed Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung as it was developed at the Shaolin Temple and is focused on cultivating chi, or energy, from the heavens, or the cosmos.  The essence of Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung lies in the skills of entering a chi kung state of mind and generating a chi flow to cleanse the system.</p>

   <p>One practice session of Cosmos Chi Kung generally lasts between 10-20 minutes, making it ideal for the daily schedule that most people maintain.  While the practice time is short compared to many other arts, Cosmos Chi Kung is highly efficient and effective and the benefits are quickly evident.</p>

   <p>It should be noted that Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung is not your average, run-of-the-mill type chi kung.  This is a high-level chi kung practice for people who want the very best available.  Because it has been refined by masters for over 1,000 years it has been condensed into only what is essential for great chi kung.  It is high-level because of how effective and efficient the practice is, bringing practitioners the intended benefits.  Part of the reason for this success is because in Shaolin Wahnam we teach the very best right from the beginning, focusing on the essential skills of chi kung that were previously mentioned.</p>
