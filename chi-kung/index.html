    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>"Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung" is a comprehensive energy art that focuses on restoring Yin-Yang harmony in the body.  This allows practitioners to enjoy good health, vitality, longevity and spiritual cultivation in the here and now.  Benefits include: reduced stress, more mental clarity, improved overall health, a renewed zest for life and inner peace.</p>

    <p>In Chinese, Chi Kung literally means "work with energy" and is an umbrella term that refers to many different styles of energy arts. The chi kung taught in Shaolin Wahnam is termed Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung as it was developed at the Shaolin Temple and is focused on cultivating chi, or energy, from the heavens, or the cosmos.  The essence of Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung lies in the skills of entering a chi kung state of mind, also known as "entering zen" and generating a chi flow to cleanse the system.</p>

   <p>One practice session of Cosmos Chi Kung generally lasts between 10-20 minutes, making it ideal for the daily schedule that most people maintain.  While the practice time is short compared to many other arts, Cosmos Chi Kung is highly efficient and effective and the benefits are quickly evident.</p>

   <p>It should be noted that Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung is a high-level chi kung practice for people who want the very best available.  Because it has been refined by masters for over 1,000 years it has been condensed into only what is essential for great chi kung.  It is high-level because of how effective and efficient the practice is, often bringing practitioners even more benefits than they had hoped for.  Part of the reason for this success is because in Shaolin Wahnam we teach the very best of the art right from the beginning, focusing on the essential skills of chi kung that were previously mentioned.</p>

   <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to practice chi kung?</p>
    
    <p>There are many different styles of chi kung and each one is practiced differently.  Regarding Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung, one session typically lasts 10-20 minutes from start to finish.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">Can I learn Chi Kung from books and videos?</p>
    
    <p>It's possible to learn low-level chi kung this way, but not the essential internal skills that are necessary for a genuine, effective practice.  Chi Kung, and any other internal art, should be learned directly from a competent teacher.  You will save yourself a lot of time and effort if you learn from a teacher, rather than trying to teach yourself.</p>

    <p>Similarly, it would be a very poor idea to try teach yourself how to swim from a book or video.  Just like Chi Kung, swimming is very safe and simple when you learn correctly, but you would be unwise to read about how to swim and then jump in a pool.</p>

    <hr>
   
    <p class="faq-question">Where and when should I practice chi kung?</p>
    <p>Some general guidelines are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s best not to practice within 1/2 a mile from a graveyard, hospital or power plant and not during a thunderstorm.</li>
      <li>Don’t practice outdoors in direct sunlight, except during early hour and late afternoon hours; don’t practice directly under rain, but under some form of cover is okay.</li>
      <li>The best place to practice is outdoors, such as in your yard, garden or in a park where chi can flow freely.  If you practice indoors, open a window to allow fresh chi to circulate.</li>
      <li>In general, refrain from practicing between 11am - 3pm when the energy from the sun is strongest.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="faq-question">Are there any dietary restrictions for practicing chi kung?</p>
    <p>No. But, Chi Kung will naturally guide you to a healthy diet, and at the same time help you enjoy your food even more!</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">Can a person of any religion practice chi kung?</p>
    <p>Yes, the Shaolin Arts are non-religious and are practiced by people of many different faiths.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">What makes Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung different from other styles of chi kung?</p>
    <p>Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung emphasizes the chi flow component, rather than focusing on physical forms and techniques.  What really raises it to a high-level art is practicing at the mind level, rather than just physical or energetic levels.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">I often struggle with excessive thinking, how will chi kung help me?</p>
    <p>At the fundamental level, everything is energy, including your thoughts.  As Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung cleanses you at every level, including body, energy and mind, over time your practice clears away mind energy that is out of balance.  By including standing meditation in the practice, we also give ourselves time to enjoy being thought-free, something which is generally feared in Western society.</p>
