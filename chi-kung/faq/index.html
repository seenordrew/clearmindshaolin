    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p class="faq-question">How long does it take to practice chi kung?</p>
    
    <p>There are many different styles of chi kung and each one is practiced differently.  Regarding Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung, one session typically lasts 10-20 minutes from start to finish.</p>

    <hr>
   
    <p class="faq-question">Where and when should I practice chi kung?</p>
    <p>Some general guidelines are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s best not to practice within 1/2 a mile from a graveyard, hospital or power plant and not during a thunderstorm.</li>
      <li>Don’t practice outdoors in direct sunlight, except during early hour and late afternoon hours; don’t practice directly under rain, but under some form of cover is okay.</li>
      <li>The best place to practice is outdoors, such as in your yard, garden or in a park where chi can flow freely.  If you practice indoors, open a window to allow fresh chi to circulate.</li>
      <li>In general, refrain from practicing between 11am - 3pm when the energy from the sun is strongest.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="faq-question">Are there any dietary restrictions for practicing chi kung?</p>
    <p>No.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">Can a person of any religion practice chi kung?</p>
    <p>Yes, the Shaolin Arts are non-religious and are practiced by people of many different faiths.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">What makes Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung different from other styles of chi kung?</p>
    <p>Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung emphasizes the chi flow component, rather than focusing on physical forms and techniques.  What really raises it to a high-level art is practicing at the mind level, rather than just physical or energetic levels.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="faq-question">I often struggle with excessive thinking, how will chi kung help me?</p>
    <p>At the fundamental level, everything is energy, including your thoughts.  As Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung cleanses you at every level, including body, energy and mind, over time your practice clears away mind energy that is out of balance.  By including standing meditation in the practice, we also give ourselves time to enjoy being thought-free, something which is generally feared in Western society.</p>
